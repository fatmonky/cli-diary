# Additional - diaryProject
_30 Dec 2024 0936hrs_
I have created a diaryProject: this is a command-line interface diary program, written in Go, which allows the user to create, update, read or delete a diary entry file, directly from the command-line

The purpose of this CLI app is to scratch my own itch: I often focus on my tasks, and end the day without any reflection of how the day went. So the day ends without any retrospection, which is a wasted learning opportunity.

Having this CLI app serves to force me to reflect on what went well, what didn't go so well, and what could be improved for the next day. 

I will dogfood this app for a while, and make iterative tweaks and improvements to the project along the way. 

# TODOs
- [ ] To refactor codebase: a lot of repetition
